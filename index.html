       If there's one place where svaed seconds can seriously add up, it's in your smartphone's on-screen keyboard. This doesn't get nearly enough attention among average tech-totin' animals, but Andriodhas an awesome advantage over that (cough, cough) other mobile platform when it comes to text input. All it takes is two minutes of trying to type text on a iDevice to see just how much of a good thing we've go t goin' (and to make yourself ant to gouge your eyes out with the nearest overpriced Apple accessory). And you know what? While we've got no shortage of commendable Andriod Keyboard apps to choose from, Google's own Gboard keyboard really is the perfect exmaple of how simple, effective and expandable the Andriod typing experience can be. Gboard works well right out of the virtual box, and once you start poking arounf in the mustiest corners of its settings, you'll uncover some tucked-away treasures that can inject all sorts of seconds-saving sorcery into your Andriod input process. Some crack those phanlanges and prepare for pro-level productivity: we're diving in deep to Gboard's least traveled surfaces to take your Andriod typing experience to dizzying new speeds. First and foremost, if you're anything like most dual-thumed Andriod phone owners, you probably waste tons of time hunting for symbols on your andriod device's keyboard-- everything from pluses to parentheses. Well, my fellow fast-fingered feline, there is better way...
